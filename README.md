# rust-stringutils
This crate contains various string utility functions for Rust, hopefully useful ones. New functions
are added as needed.

## Overview
* ``byte_array_to_string``: Convert a slice of type ``[u8]`` to a ``String``.
* ``timestamp_to_string``: Convert a timestamp (in seconds) into a human-readable representation.

## Dependencies
* The `libc` crate (as of version 0.0.2).
